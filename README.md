# Startup-LinearRegression

Linear regression is used when the dataset has a linear correlation. Before buildinga linear regression model assumptions are to be validated. If the assumptions are violated, different methodologies must be used. 

1. R&D spending: The amount which startups are spending on Research and development.
2. Administration spending: The amount which startups are spending on the Admin panel.
3. Marketing spending: The amount which startups are spending on marketing strategies.
4. State: To which state that particular startup belongs.
5. Profit: How much profit that particular startup is making.

For the dataset the first 3 features are used to predict Profit. These columns contain numerical data and the fourth column contains categorical data for the 3 US states which are California, Florida, and New York.
